Random scripts and old code I like to keep around. This also serves as an archive for my older code that I sometimes reference but don't host on GitHub anymore.

	- MinecraftPlugins
		- canyoudumbass
			- Screams at you for placing and breaking blocks, basically just a testing ground for getting block info.
		- AlylTroll
			- This was a plugin used to tell people when a user played a Disc, for trolling purposes.
- JavaScript
	- DiscordBots
		- THANOS
			- A small bot I used for fun and wanted to turn into a usable thing, I think? It was at the height of Thanos snapping memes.
		- furbley
			- Completely do not remember what this was used for. AFAIK it appears to be a direct rip of my bot [Furrtron](https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf/furrtron) but I included it anyways.
		- furrtron-test
			- Testing grounds for my bot [Furrtron](https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf/furrtron), probably one of my best Discord bots for the time. The regular bot is archived at the link provided.
		- gerald-bot
			- Yet another bot I do not remember creating, at all! I guess this is from May 2020, yet I have 0 recollection of creating it then. It seems to do fuck all.
		- maddie-test
			- The testing grounds for my first ever Discord bot, [Maddie](https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf/maddie-bot) which is in archive here on GitHub still. This is how I learned JS, NodeJS, DiscordJS, and got my first real foot into programming. Thank you so much to An Idiot's Guide who taught me this on YouTube.
		- skid-bot & skid-bot-test
			- I grouped these since they're similar. This was a bot for a server I was trying to make and is similar to [Furrtron](https://github.com/ZenIsBestWolf/furrtron). The "-test" version is obviously the testing grounds.
