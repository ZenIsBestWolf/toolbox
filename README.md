# toolbox
Small trinkets and tools of code I like to keep. Should no license be found in the folder in which the code is contained, it is Public Domain, otherwise respect the License file.

## Directory

- Sort.py
  - Prints a sorted by size (descending) list of folders within the given directory.
- PullAll.py
  - Runs git pull on all subdirectories where the script is located.
